The only problem, was that my daughter wouldn't eat the food (that's why I put her in the camp, hoping she'd try something). That's not a reflection on the camp at all! The camp was amazing in getting her engaged, and seeing all the different foods she could cook. She also got to do some yoga, and the art! My daughter enjoyed herself very much! I will definitely put her in the camp again next year. Thanks!"</div><a href="https://www.activityhero.com/widgets/schedule_with_photo?aht_cam=new-schedule-widget&aht_src=54220&classes=true&locations=115130,67239,86832,86833,66128,67391,109873,66127,53259&show_photos=true&show_schedules=published_upcoming,unpublished_upcoming&widget_id=806" target="_blank" id="sidebarbutton">REGISTER NOW!</a>

                <h1>Leadership & CIT program</h1>
                <p>Growing years are not easy in current times.</p>
                <p>The pre-teen and teenage years can be a tough and confusing time for children and parents alike. Right on the cusp of adulthood, yet not quite ready to handle the responsibilities that “real life” has in store for them.</p>

                <p>Summer can be especially challenging as they are not quite at the age yet to take on a serious job, but need to begin exploring career path options.</p>

                <p>“Counselor in Training” and “Leader in Training” programs are designed for junior high and high school students who feel they’ve grown out of summer camps and are looking for something a little more challenging. Sort of a stepping stone into adulthood, you might say.</p>

                <h2>Activity Hero</h2>

                <p>At Art & Soul, the CITs become a part of the staff structure of the group, usually with a counselor and a junior counselor. The CIT Program helps develop leadership skills, time management, interpersonal skills and students earn community service hours as well as give participants real work experience. Teens learn leadership skills, patience & behavior management while working with young children. Counselors are encouraged to participate in creating art or cooking project of their own if they desire to get a camper experience.</p>

                <h1>Visual Arts</h1>

                <p>Our visual arts program highlights world cultures, individual artist, their work and significance. Using a variety of media, our students experience a robust, creative process. They strengthen observational skills and develop drawing, sculpture and painting techniques in contemporary and classical style.</p>

                <p>Children spend time in the studio working on independent projects with artist quality materials.</p>

                <p>Goals for campers are to improve their observational skills, develop their drawing, painting and sculptural techniques. Campers engage in a design thinking approach to learning and ideation.</p>

                <p>Some of our projects include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Plaster sculpted animals</li>

                    <li>Puppets and puppet theater construction</li>

                    <li>Group Mural project</li>

                    <li>Silk dye painting</li>

                    <li>Clay sculpted food & human form</li>

                    <li>Foil embossing</li>

                    <li>Landscape painting on canvas</li>

                    <li>Watercolor painting</li>

                    <li>Portrait painting</li>

                    <li>Candle making</li>

                    <li>Craft projects and more</li>
                </ul>

                <p style="margin-top: 3%;">Each day there will be an art and cooking project.</p>

                <p>Projects and recipes differ each session.</p>

                <p>Some days the art project will be a multi day affair.</p>

                <p>Yoga and storytelling get us started each morning and mindfulness help to refocus after lunch.</p>

                <p>Craft and tinkering projects will be offered as free choice activities throughout the day.</p>

                <p>We will enjoy a bag lunch under the trees and break for snacks in the morning and afternoon to enjoy what we have cooked.</p>

                <p>Families are invited to join the festivities on Friday at 2:20 for an opportunity to sample our cooking and view our art.</p>

                <p>At 2:30, enjoy the camper written, produced and performed puppet shows.</p>

                <h1>Cooking</h1>

                <p>Our culinary program, with ethnically diverse recipes, focuses on a variety of ingredients and techniques. We explore techniques such as; sautéing, baking, poaching, and grilling, among other culinary techniques. Students develop confidence and expand on science, math, reading, health and social skills while preparing healthy snacks and meals.</p>

                <p>Most kids love to cook, it's hands on, it's messy and there's plenty of room for creativity, not to mention a sense of achievement at the end. We teach kids this life skill and try to set them up for life. Campers have fun developing culinary confidence in the kitchen by learning various cooking techniques. They also expand on science, math, reading, health and social skills while preparing healthy snacks and meals. A few of the foods from around the world, they design & create are:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>French Lemon Crepes</li>

                    <li>Belgian Waffles & fruit/Blueberry Cream Cheese Cakes</li>

                <h2>PLEASE NOTE:</h2>

                <p>Cooking at the camp provides snacks to share (not intended as a meal) and the tasting menu for our art show on Friday.Families and friends are invited to join the “Art Show” festivities on Friday for an opportunity to sample our cooking and view camper’s art. Friday afternoon session continues after the art show.</p>
                <h1>Yoga & Mindfulness</h1>

                <p>We use yoga techniques to develop a sense of themselves and the present in children. They learn to breathe, focus, balance and relax. In a world of infinite possibilities we teach them to take one step at a time and enjoy the changing environment around them.</p>

                <p>"Scientific evidence suggests that mindfulness interventions improve attention, self-control, emotional resilience, memory and immune response.”</p>

                <h2>Mindful School</h2>

                <p>Our program utilizes the Mindful Schools Curriculum.</p>
